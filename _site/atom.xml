   <title>DIY Faraday Isolator</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/11/10/diy-faraday-isolator/"/>
   <updated>2021-11-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2021/11/10/diy-faraday-isolator</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For a discussion of the motivation behind Faraday isolators, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:40002021/10/14/the-monochromatic-laser/&quot;&gt;see the section on frequency-stabilized lasers&lt;/a&gt;. The following is a guide on how to fabricate a low-cost alternative to commercial Faraday isolators (typically &amp;gt;$1000 in cost).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Faraday isolator utilizes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_effect&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faraday effect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;polarization of light&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to allow the transmission of light in only one direction. Thus, the four main components of a Faraday isolator are: an input linear polarizer, a strong magnetic field, a nonlinear optical crystal, and an output linear polarizer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;theory&quot;&gt;Theory&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Faraday &lt;em&gt;rotator&lt;/em&gt; is comprised of the magnetic field and the nonlinear optical crystal. The optical crystal is oriented within the magnetic field, such that its optical axis is parallel to the direction of the magnetic field. Then, as light passes through the crystal, its polarization state is rotated by an angle:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\theta = VBL\]

&lt;figure style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 20px; width:40%; height:auto;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/static/projects/mot/tgg.png&quot; /&gt;
     &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: 13px; margin-top:-15px;&quot;&gt;The Verdet constant vs. wavelength plot for terbium gallium garnet&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where \(V\) is the &lt;strong&gt;Verdet constant&lt;/strong&gt; of the crystal, \(B\) is the magnitude of the magnetic field within the crystal (assumed to be constant), and \(L\) is the length of the crystal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Verdet constant is a material property, and is typically very low for most crystals - the discover of novel materials that enable Faraday rotation is an active area of research. Moreover, the Verdet constant is wavelength (and temperature) dependent, meaning that a different magnetic field strength and length will be required for different light sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most common materials used for Faraday rotation is &lt;strong&gt;terbium gallium garnet&lt;/strong&gt; (TGG). This crystal has a very high Verdet constant - approximately 61 radians per meter-Tesla at 780nm. Thus, to achieve a 45 degree (0.785 radian) rotation (the necessary rotation for optical isolation), we require 0.0128 meter-Teslas. Since magnets are much cheaper than TGG, we utilize the strongest ring magnet we can find, thus reducing the necessary length of the TGG crystal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 20px; width:40%; height:auto;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/static/projects/mot/femm.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this purpose, we utilize the two of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kjmagnetics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=RX828&quot;&gt;K&amp;amp;J Magnetics RX828&lt;/a&gt;, which is a 1.5 inch outer diameter, 0.125 inch inner diameter, 0.5 inch thick axially magnetized ring magnet. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.femm.info/wiki/HomePage&quot;&gt;a finite elements simulation&lt;/a&gt;, the magnetic field magnitude along the central axis of this magnet is roughly 0.64 Tesla. Therefore, we require a 20mm long TGG crystal to complete the Faraday rotator (0.0128 meter-Tesla / 0.64 Tesla = 0.02 meter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;assembly&quot;&gt;Assembly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fabrication of the optical isolator is remarkably simple. I purchased the TGG crystal from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crystro.com/&quot;&gt;Crystro&lt;/a&gt;, a Chinese manufacturer, for about $120 (I am not affiliated with this company in any way - but to note, North American manufacturers quoted me $600+ for the same crystal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TGG crystal must be inserted down the hole of the ring magnets; for this, I used a 3mm outer diameter, 2mm inner diameter resin sheath 3D printed on a Formlabs Form2 SLA printer. The resin sheath has a small hole in the side that can be used to epoxy the crystal in place without fear of damaging the optical surfaces. I rely on the tension fit between the sheath and the inner diameter of the magnets to hold it in place. This should be quite secure unless you are shaking the rotator violently (not recommended) or pushing on the sheath with tweezers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mounted the magnets in two 3D printed covers. In hindsight, I regret doing this, because it made the device much bigger than it needed to be. However, this also allows me to mount it on an optical post, which can then be put on a breadboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complete the Faraday isolator, we need two linear polarizers. These are commonly available on eBay for about $15 each (although this is also highly dependent on the wavelength of light you are using). The polarization axes of the polarizers must be offset by 45 degrees. When these are mounted on either end of the rotator, light should only be able to travel through in the direction of the magnetic field!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure style=&quot;display: inline-block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 40%;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/static/projects/mot/rotator-front.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure style=&quot;display: inline-block;

  width: 23%;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/static/projects/mot/rotator-side.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my build, I achieve roughly 45% transmission and 32dB isolation using a 200mW 780nm laser. A possible cause of the relatively low transmission is due to the fact that my laser beam is likely diverging before exiting the rotator (due to its relative long length and small diameter); better beam tightening and collimation may lead to better transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The following is a guide on how to fabricate a low-cost alternative to commercial mirror mounts (around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=KM05&quot;&gt;$40 at their cheapest&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, these allow you to customize your optics holder for any shape and size of optical element, which I found particularly useful as I was buying random surplus off of eBay. As a disclaimer, these mounts will have more thermal drift than anything commercial, and thus are less suitable for long-term experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;theory&quot;&gt;Theory&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kinematic mirror mounts are optomechanical devices ubiquitous in optical systems as they provide the ability to precisely tune the direction of a laser beam. This is achieved through the use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematic_coupling&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kinematic couplings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from which these devices get their name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kinematic coupling fixtures constrain a baseplate and optics holder to be aligned in a fixed and highly repeatable manner, by ensuring that there are exactly six points of contact between the two (restricting the six mutual degrees of freedom between them). The method of affixing the baseplate and optics holder together is typically either via extension springs (most common) or magnets (but never bolts, as this would defeat the purpose of having only six points of contact).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 20px; width:40%; height:auto;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/static/projects/mot/kinematics.gif&quot; /&gt;
     &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: 13px; margin-top:-15px;&quot;&gt;A visual demonstration of how a kinematic mirror mount works&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The six points of contact in a kinematic mirror mount are given by three round-tip screws through the baseplate that contact grooves in the optics holder. As the screws are driven, they push against one side of the optics holder, forcing it to tilt slightly in that direction. Thus, if the optics holder is holding a mirror with a laser beam incident on it, the output beam directionality will shift correspondingly. The springs holding the two pieces together provide a restoring force to un-tilt the optics holder if the screw is loosened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;assembly&quot;&gt;Assembly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I salvaged mirrors from a broken LCD projector (which, as an aside, is a great source of mirrors, prisms, lenses, and dichroics!), hence the random dimensions of 26x20mm. The mirror should slot into the mirror holder tightly enough to provide a tension fit to prevent any unwanted mechanical disturbance (you can modify the design to include a tension screw, or you can epoxy the mirror in, for extra sturdiness).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, epoxy your bushings into the holes in the kinematic mount. I used three M4 bushings for the adjustment screw holes, and an M3 bushing for the set screw hole to mount onto an optics post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 20px; width:40%; height:auto;&quot;&gt;

     &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: 13px; margin-top:-15px;&quot;&gt;Hook the spring on a dowel pin and pick the pin up with tweezers&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, thread a steel dowel pin through one of the loops on the end of a spring. Drop the dowel pin (with the spring attached) through the smaller hole in the kinematic mount, so that the dowel pin sits in the rectangular inset in the mount. Place a piece of scotch tape over the inset, so that the dowel pin and spring do not fall out. Do this for both insets. Then, flip the mirror mount over, and lift up the spring loop with a pair of tweezers. Use a second pair of tweezers to pick up another dowel pin and slide it through the spring loop. Do this for both spring slots, and then scotch tape over these holes as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 20px; width:40%; height:auto;&quot;&gt;

     &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: 13px; margin-top:-15px;&quot;&gt;Tape over the dowel pins so they do not fall out when you flip the device&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step is to screw your M4 ball-tip screws into the bushings until they sit in the triangular mounting insets in the mirror holder. Drive the screws far enough so that the springs are under tension, and the dowel pins will not fall out on their own. Then, the scotch tape can be removed, the mirror mount is fully assembled.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Monochromatic Laser</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/10/14/the-monochromatic-laser/"/>
   <updated>2021-10-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2021/10/14/the-monochromatic-laser</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;photon-absorption&quot;&gt;Photon Absorption&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental phenomenon that enables precise control, cooling, and trapping of neutral atoms is the excitation of bound electrons through the absorption of photons. &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:40002021/10/13/intro-to-atomic-trapping/&quot;&gt;As discussed previously&lt;/a&gt;, exciting an electron to a higher energy state requires the absorption of a photon within a very specific range of frequencies/energies. This range is known as the &lt;em&gt;line width&lt;/em&gt; of an atomic transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A discussion of the line width of atomic transitions is ubiquitous in atomic physics texts, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books/about/Atomic_Physics.html?id=kXYpAQAAMAAJ&quot;&gt;C.J. Foot&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books/about/Modern_Atomic_Physics.html?id=b5K9BwAAQBAJ&quot;&gt;Vasant Natarajan&lt;/a&gt;. In essence, these derivations show how the transition rate of an atom varies with respect to the frequency of incident light, which is typically a Lorentzian distribution centered at the resonant frequency of the transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABSORPTION DIAGRAM IMAGE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this, typical treatments of the radiation pressure force (the ‘pressure’ exerted on an atom by the absorption and emission of incident photons) tend to assume that the frequency of incident light can be tuned arbitrarily close to this resonant frequency, so that the transition rate is maximized. However, in practice, it is exceedingly difficult to create a light source that is truly monochromatic, i.e. that emits a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; stable frequency of light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common form of light source used in magneto-optical trapping is the &lt;em&gt;laser&lt;/em&gt;, as they are coherent sources of photons and are spatially precise. There are many variants of lasers, e.g. diode lasers, gas lasers, diode-pumped solid-state lasers, and so on. All of these variants are subject to &lt;em&gt;frequency drift&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. the frequency of photons that these lasers emit changes stochastically as a function of time due to random fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A popular choice in the construction of MOTs is the diode laser, as they are relatively inexpensive, and the process of stabilizing their emitted frequency is well-studied. In particular, diode lasers are often stabilized with the addition of an external cavity and a diffraction grating that allows for the fine-tuning of the output frequency of light so that the laser can remain within the line width of the desired atomic transition. These apparatus are known as &lt;strong&gt;external cavity diode lasers&lt;/strong&gt; (ECDL), and are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/5694&quot;&gt;arguably the most common tools in an atomic physics lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;external-cavity-diode-lasers&quot;&gt;External Cavity Diode Lasers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;optical-configurations&quot;&gt;Optical Configurations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;littrow-ecdl&quot;&gt;Littrow ECDL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of configurations for external cavity diode lasers presented in the literature. The simplest, and thus most common, is the &lt;strong&gt;Littrow ECDL&lt;/strong&gt;, depicted in the figure to the right. The laser diode is directed at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazed_grating&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blazed diffraction grating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. Thorlabs GR13-0608, $70) in the external cavity, which diffracts the light and thus alters its wavelength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIGURE: LITTROW ECDL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, the wavelength of light after diffraction is given by the well-known optical equation:&lt;/p&gt;

\[n \lambda = d(\sin \theta + \sin \theta')\]

&lt;p&gt;where \(n\) is the order of diffraction, \(\lambda\) is the diffracted wavelength, \(d\) is the grating constant (distance between grooves), \(\theta\) is incident angle of the diode with respect to the diffraction grating (i.e. the angle with the unit normal of the grating), and \(\theta'\) is exit angle of the diffracted beam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Littrow ECDL configuration, \(\theta = \theta'\), so this reduces to:&lt;/p&gt;

\[n \lambda = 2d \sin \theta\]

&lt;p&gt;The motivation for such a configuration is due to the nature of stimulated emission of photons. In particular, when we direct our laser diode at the blazed diffraction grating at some angle \(\theta\), thereby generating first-order diffracted light at a wavelength \(\lambda\), some of that diffracted light will be reflected back into the diode. Within the gain medium of the diode, that diffracted light will serve to amplify the emission of light at the diffracted wavelength. Therefore, if we want our laser to output light sharply peaked at some wavelength \(\lambda^\ast\), we simply mount the diffraction grating at an incident angle of \(\theta^\ast = \arcsin \frac{\lambda^\ast}{2d}\), which will amplify the emission of light at the wavelength \(\lambda^\ast\) as desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To control the incident angle onto the diffraction grating, we use a &lt;strong&gt;piezoelectric actuator&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. Thorlabs PK4FA2P1, $52) mounted behind a lever arm, which holds the grating. As the actuator expands, it pushes the lever arm, changing the diffraction angle slightly. An actuator with a maximum travel length of \(10 \mu m\) to \(20 \mu m\) is generally sufficient to sweep through the range of angles that will allow an experimentalist to lock the output of their ECDL to the desired frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For rubidium-87, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://steck.us/alkalidata/rubidium87numbers.1.6.pdf&quot;&gt;canonical ‘cooling transition’ has a resonant wavelength \(780.241209\) nm (in vacuum)&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, if we had a grating with 1800 grooves per mm, and wanted to be exactly on resonance, we would choose:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\theta = \arcsin \frac{780.241209 \text{nm}}{\frac{2}{1800} \text{grooves/mm}} = 44.6031975^\circ\]

&lt;p&gt;FIGURE: DIODE MOUNT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, as depicted in the Littrow diagram above, the output beam of the diode must be collimated as it is emitted, via some beam limiting device (e.g. Laser-Makers 16mm beam collimator, $10). This is because most laser diodes produce inherently divergent beams, and too much power would be lost from this beam divergence to eventually be useful downstream in the experiment. Figure \ref{fig:diodemount}, above, depicts a diode mount. The empty cavity in front of the diode is left for a beam collimator; 4-6mm of threading is given to adjust the collimator back and forth on the same optical axis as the laser diode, so that the collimation can be adjusted as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One disadvantage specific to the Littrow ECDL is that the output beam direction varies as the frequency is tuned. For tasks requiring highly precise beam alignment, this may have unwanted consequences in the downstream application. A similar configuration using a blazed diffraction grating known as the &lt;strong&gt;Littman-Metcalf&lt;/strong&gt; ECDL obviates this issue by using a rotating mirror to select the output frequency (rather than rotating the grating itself). However, this configuration suffers from a relatively low power output as compared to the Littrow configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cateye-ecdl&quot;&gt;‘Cateye’ ECDL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘cateye’, or ‘interference filter’ ECDL is an alternative configuration that utilizes an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_filter&quot;&gt;interference filter&lt;/a&gt; for frequency selection, as opposed to the phenomenon of diffraction. In particular, a rotating interference filter is placed in front of the laser diode; as the filter is rotated, the incident light undergoes multiple reflections within the filter’s dielectric coatings, and behaves essentially as a thin Fabry-Perot etalon. The transmitted wavelength is given by:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\lambda = \lambda_{max} \sqrt{1 - \frac{\sin^2 \theta}{n_{eff}^2}}\]

&lt;p&gt;where \(n_{eff}\) is the effective index of refraction of the filter (typically around \(2\)), \(\lambda_{max}\) is the wavelength at normal incidence, and \(\theta\) is the angle of incidence of the filter with respect to the laser beam. Once the desired frequency has been selected by adjusting the rotation of the filter, the light at that exact frequency is partially reflected back into the laser diode by using an ‘output coupler’ (partially reflecting mirror), usually with a ratio of about 30% reflection to 70% transmittance. By the same principles of stimulated emission described in the previous section, this sharply peaks the output frequency of the ECDL about the selected frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fine control of the frequency is achieved by focusing the light using a (typically plano-convex) lens onto the output coupler mirror. The frequency can be tuned by adjusting the distance from the lens to the output coupler, typically using a piezoelectric actuator to achieve control on the nanometer scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interference filter has several&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stabilization-and-electronics&quot;&gt;Stabilization and Electronics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;blah blah femtometer stability&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To control the ECDL in the configuration proposed above, three drivers are required: a current driver for the laser diode, a temperature controller for the Peltier device and temperature sensor, and a voltage controller for the piezo actuator. In this work, we do not cover such drivers in detail, as there are countless valid circuits for these purposes that are well-studied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of our experiment, we utilize the works described in \cite{minho}, \cite{current}, and \cite{piezo}. One practical motivation for the usage of these drivers is that they are all digitally-enabled, which allows us to have end-to-end data collection and feedback on the same processor. In particular, a Teensy 3.5 digital microcontroller is used to manage the three component drivers. Figure \ref{fig:temppcb} depicts a PCB diagram for the temperature controller used in our experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;temperature-control&quot;&gt;Temperature Control&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key aspect to proper ECDL operation is precise control of the temperature of the laser diode \cite{tunable}. The wavelength of light that is output by a laser diode changes with respect to temperature (see \ref{fig:tempvswl}, typically because the thermal fluctuation will change the length of the internal cavity of the diode. As more current is provided to the laser diode, the temperature will rise, thereby changing the wavelength and possibly disrupting the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, ECDLs are generally assembled with some form of cooling mechanism, such as a &lt;strong&gt;Peltier device&lt;/strong&gt; (a.k.a. thermoelectric cooler, e.g. CUI Devices CP60231H, $20). When used in conjunction with a thermally conductive mounting apparatus for the diode, as well as some form of heatsink, a Peltier device is able to transfer heat away from the diode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3in]{figures/Temp vs Wavelength.png}
\caption{The variation of laser diode wavelength with respect to cavity temperature}
\label{fig:tempvswl}
\end{figure}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep the temperature stable about a set value, experimentalists often use analog circuits, in which temperature measurements are taken by an analog sensor (e.g. Analog Devices AD590, $15), and used in conjunction with a proportional–integral–derivative loop to adjust the input current to the Peltier device such that temperature remains constant. See Figure \ref{fig:diodemount} for an example of such a configuration: the bottom plate depicted is a heatsink; the Peltier device is sandwiched between the heatsink and the bottom half of the diode mount, and a temperature sensor is inserted into the top half of the diode mount (as close to the diode as possible) to get temperature readings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;optical-isolator&quot;&gt;Optical Isolator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed in Section \ref{sec:ecdloptics}, the mechanics of an ECDL necessarily depend on the nature of stimulated emission; specifically, the fact that light reflected back into the diode can stimulate a higher level of emission at a desired wavelength. However, this effect can also backfire, if light reflected back into the diode is not of the desired wavelength. Without proper precautions, this phenomenon can easily occur in experiments, as the light emitted by the ECDL is reflected by other optical elements in the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical solution to this problem is to utilize an \textbf{optical isolator} in conjunction with the light output from the ECDL. An optical isolator is an optical element that makes use of the physical phenomenon of \textit{Faraday rotation}, or the rotation of the polarization of light within certain nonlinear crystals \cite{fischer_1987}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{figures/isolator.png}
\caption{Typical configuration of an optical isolator}
\label{fig:isolator}
\end{figure}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such crystals are characterized by their \textit{Verdet constant}, which is a measure of how many radians the polarization of incident light is rotated by, per meter, per Tesla. A Faraday rotator is built by placing a nonlinear crystal within a region of axial magnetic flux; as the light passes through this region, its polarization will be rotated by an angle given by:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\Delta \theta = V \beta L,\]

&lt;p&gt;where $V$ is the Verdet constant of the crystal, $\beta$ is the axial magnitude flux in the crystal, and $L$ is the length of the crystal \cite{moller}. To create an optical isolator, then, we first place a linear polarizer (e.g. Melles Griot 03FPG009, $35) in front of such a Faraday rotator. This ensures that the light entering the Faraday rotator is uniformly polarized. Subsequently, we add a 45° polarizer (a.k.a. analyzer) after the rotator; this ensures that only the light whose polarization has been rotated by 45° can exit the isolator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that light trying to pass through the optical isolator in the opposite direction would first be polarized to an angle of 45°, and then rotated another 45° by the Faraday rotator (since the rotator is orientation-agnostic). Therefore, the light exiting the rotator in this direction would be polarized orthogonally to the linear polarizer at the other end, meaning that it will be extinguished, and no more light will be reflected back into the ECDL, as desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common choices for nonlinear crystals for use in the Faraday rotator are terbium-doped glass or terbium gallium garnet (TGG) due to their high Verdet constant. Specifically, for the 780nm transition of Rubidium, the Verdet constant of TGG is approximately 60 radians per meter-Tesla. By the above equation, then, to achieve a 45 degree rotation ($\approx 0.785$ radians), we require $\approx 0.013$ meter-Teslas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be achieved by a $15.5$mm length TGG crystal (purchasing TGG generally requires a custom order from a manufacturer; Chinese manufacturers will produce such a piece for $\sim$ $80 at the time of writing), and $19$mm of permanent toroidal magnets that generate a $.85$ Tesla axial field at their center (e.g. K&amp;amp;J Magnetics RC44-N52 x 3, $16 and K&amp;amp;J Magnetics R412-N52 x 6, $3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;optical-pumping&quot;&gt;Optical ‘Pumping’&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we utilize the $780$nm transition of Rubidium-85 to excite atoms in the $5^2 S_{1/2}$ ground state to the $5^2 P_{3/2}$ state, this corresponds to a $F=3 \to F’=4$ transition. By angular selection rules, the $F’=4$ state must decay back into the $F=3$ state, meaning that the atoms can be immediately excited once again (and therefore cooled, via the principles of the radiation pressure force). However, due to the phenomenon of \textit{Raman scattering}, there is a possibility that Rubidium-85 atoms will end up in a hyperfine split $F=2$ state, which is `dark’ with respect to the $780$nm light \cite{rbdata}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More generally, all alkali elements are subject to such a phenomenon in one form or another, which typically necessitates the usage of a secondary \textbf{repumping laser} that removes atoms from this &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dark state'. In Rb-85, this involves an excitation from the $F=2$ to the $5^2 P_{3/2}, F'=3$ state, which will then decay back down to $5^2 S_{1/2}, F=3$, the ground state, making such an atom ready for cooling cycles once again. One favorable property of this particular&lt;/code&gt;repumping’ transition in Rb-85 is that it is very close in natural frequency to the cooling transition, being separated by only 2.9GHz. This may be compared to another alkali element, such as Potassium-40, which has a cooling transition at $405$nm and a corresponding repumping transition at $767$nm, which is a much wider gap \cite{PhysRevA.84.063420}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.2in]{figures/rb repumping.png}
\caption{An energy diagram depicting the cooling and repumping transition for Rubidium-85}
\label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may take advantage of this property by generating a \textit{sideband} in the output beam $780$nm &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cooling' ECDL that can access this Rb-85 repumping transition. In electromagnetic radiation, a sideband is a band of frequencies that is higher or lower than the main&lt;/code&gt;carrier’ frequency, which arises as a result of a modulation process (e.g. voltage controlled oscillation or acousto-optical deflection). In other words, we can modulate the $780$nm diode laser such that it will simultaneously generate light at the repumping frequency, so that the experiment can be run with a single ECDL, which greatly reduces both experiment cost and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;voltage-controlled-oscillators&quot;&gt;Voltage Controlled Oscillators&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cheap and simple implementation of such modulation can be done via the use of a \textbf{voltage controlled oscillator}, or VCO (e.g. Avantek VTO-8240, $55). In particular, for Rb-85 repumping, a microwave oscillator whose range of oscillation is approximately centered about 2.9GHz is optimal. Due to the relatively broad ($\approx 100$ MHz) line width of the repumping transition, specific details such as harmonic vs. relaxation oscillation and noise figure are not expressly important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VCO is a circuit element that can be placed in parallel with the ECDL circuit and a single additional capacitor. It is provided with a separate DC driving voltage, which controls the frequency of oscillation of the VCO. This, in turn, adds an AC voltage source to the circuit that drives the laser diode. The input current to a laser diode directly affects its cavity length, which means that this AC modulation will cause a corresponding oscillation in the output frequency of the diode (as the diode’s cavity length directly controls the output frequency of light) \cite{microwave}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the line width of the repumping transition of Rb-85 is relatively large, tuning the DC input to the VCO can be performed (once the remainder of the experiment is correctly set up) by scanning through a range of input voltages until the steady-state MOT is established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;frequency-locking&quot;&gt;Frequency Locking&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because stable cooling of atoms requires precise control of the frequency of applied light, it is useful (and for robust applications, necessary) to have a method of measuring the frequency of light from our light source. In this section, we present two tools for conducting such measurements: vapor cells and Fabry-Perot interferometers.
\subsubsection{Atomic Vapor Cells}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fabry-perot-interferometry&quot;&gt;Fabry-Perot Interferometry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A \textbf{Fabry-Perot cavity} (or interferometer) is an optical device constructed with two mirrors in a variable-length tube. When operated, light is transmitted through one end of the cavity, and then is reflected back and forth between the two mirrors inside the cavity. The amount of light that is transmitted through the other end of the cavity is dependent on the length of the cavity, due to the variation in the interference patterns of the reflected light inside the cavity with respect to the length \cite{hernandez_1988}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, after being transmitted through one end of the cavity, the incident light can either be transmitted through the other end, or reflected by the mirror at that end. If the light is reflected, and then once again reflected at the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;entrance' to the cavity, it returns to the&lt;/code&gt;exit’ of the cavity after some time that is dependent on the refractive index of the material inside the cavity (typically air) as well as the length of the cavity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3in]{figures/fabryperot.png}
\caption{Dynamics of reflection and transmission in a Fabry-Perot cavity}
\label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this reflected light beam is then transmitted, it has a phase difference with the initial transmitted beam that is also dependence on the cavity length and index of refraction. Specifically, if the light is incident at one end of the cavity at an angle of $\theta$, the phase difference between the first transmitted beam and the beam transmitted after two reflections is given by:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\delta = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} 2 n \ell \cos \theta,\]

&lt;p&gt;where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the incident light, $n$ is the refractive index of the cavity, and $\ell$ is the length of the cavity. Moreover, the transmittance of the cavity is given by:&lt;/p&gt;

\[T = \frac{(1-R)^{2}}{1-2 R \cos \delta+R^{2}} = \frac{1}{1 + F \sin^2 \frac{\delta}{2}},\]

&lt;p&gt;where $R$ is the \textit{reflectance} of the mirrors, and $F = \frac{4R}{(1-R)^2}$ is the \textit{finesse}. From these equations, if we take $n=1$, we can see that transmission is maximized when $\ell \cos \theta$ is an integer multiple of the wavelength. Therefore, in practice, we direct our light source at the cavity at an angle of $\theta = 0$, tune the length using a piezoelectric actuator (identical to the one used to tune the ECDL diffraction grating), and place a photodetector at the cavity `exit’. Thus, if the initial length of the cavity is known, as we vary the length using the piezo actuator, we can determine the wavelength of the light from the photodetector readings. This can be used as an error signal that then allows us to tune the parameters that determine the frequency of our light source. (Pound-Drever-Hall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;saturated-absorption-spectroscopy&quot;&gt;Saturated Absorption Spectroscopy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reliable source of frequency measurement for ground state transitions of atoms is through the usage of \textbf{atomic vapor cells}, which are containers that heat a pure sample of a particular element until it forms a vapor. In an optical experiment, some of the light from the light source can be split off via a beam splitter, directed through such a vapor cell, and then into a photodetector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the majority of the atoms in the vapor cell will be in their ground state, if the light source is emitting at the natural frequency of the cooling transition, the atoms in the vapor cell will be excited (e.g. for Rb-85, into the $5^2 P_{3/2}$ state). Some proportion of these atoms will spontaneously decay back into the ground state; when this occurs, the emitted photon has a random direction, meaning that it may not hit the photodetector that has been placed in series with the vapor cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6in]{figures/vaporcell.png}
\caption{A diagram depicting the usage of an atomic vapor cell (a.k.a. reference cell}
\label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, when the frequency of the light source is on resonance with the cooling transition, we will see a sharp dip in the absorption measurements from the photodetector, because the light beam is not passing through the vapor straight into the photodetector at that point. This can be used as an error signal, which allows an experimentalist to more precisely tune the parameters of their light source in order to achieve a desired light frequency. &lt;br /&gt;
Note that atomic vapor cells can only be used as an error signal for ground state transitions, because the vapor cell will only contain atoms in their ground state, and therefore the absorption measurement will only have meaningful fluctuations for transitions that excite atoms from their ground state.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Introduction to Atomic Trapping</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/10/13/intro-to-atomic-trapping/"/>
   <updated>2021-10-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2021/10/13/intro-to-atomic-trapping</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-atomic-physics&quot;&gt;What is Atomic Physics?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The taxonomy of scientific disciplines is often arcane and unintuitive, and physics is no exception. When one hears the phrase ‘atomic physics’, they might be tempted to assume some relationship to ‘nuclear physics’ – after all, what is an atom but a nucleus with bound electrons? Yet these two fields could hardly be more distinct, having entirely separate histories, techniques, and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theory of atomic physics typically considers individual atoms in isolation. In the early 20th century, this posed a seemingly insurmountable practical challenge – by what methods could one experimentally isolate an atom, so that those theories could be verified and further developed? At standard temperature and pressure, even relatively heavy atoms in gaseous form, such as xenon, travel at over 200 meters per second, rendering existing observational tools at the time useless for studying them. It was not until the late 1980s (more than 30 years after the development of the atomic bomb, a major breakthrough of nuclear science!), when Bell Labs scientists William Phillips, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, David Pritchard, and Steven Chu (among others) designed and fabricated the first apparatus for slowing and controlling ensembles of atoms in a gaseous or vapor form – the &lt;strong&gt;magneto-optical trap&lt;/strong&gt;. This signaled a turning point in the study of atoms; for the first time, scientists could now create gases of atoms slow enough to be studied by conventional (e.g. spectroscopic) methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 20px; width:40%; height:auto;&quot;&gt;

     &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: 13px; margin-top:-15px;&quot;&gt;A cartoon depiction of optical tweezers&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This practically instantly opened the door for a new generation of atomic physics. For example, in that same year, Steven Chu went on to utilize &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_tweezers&quot;&gt;optical tweezers&lt;/a&gt;, a particle-trapping technique that had hitherto only been utilized for controlling macroscopic particles, to isolate individual atoms from within a magneto-optical trap. It only took a few more years for several more incredible achievements in the field; for instance, in 1985, Eric Cornell and Carl Weiman were able to cool an ensemble of Rubidium-87 atoms to below 170 nanokelvin, creating the first ‘pure’ Bose-Einstein condensate, a state of matter in which all constituent particles are occupying the same state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the magneto-optical trap (henceforth ‘MOT’) is ubiquitous in atomic physics labs, as it allows for researchers to experiment on individual (or arrays of individual) atoms. The objective of such experiments are typically investigating light-matter interactions, or how the trapped atoms behave under the influence of external electromagnetic waves. Modern uses of the MOT include &lt;a href=&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2021/07/21/atom-computing-exits-stealth-quantum-computing-system-made-atoms-controlled-lasers/&quot;&gt;quantum computation&lt;/a&gt;, atomic clocks (&lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/optical-atomic-clock-advantage-expands-electronics&quot;&gt;which have been proven to be the most precise timekeepers currently existing&lt;/a&gt;), and various quantum sensors &lt;a href=&quot;https://syrte.obspm.fr/spip/science/iaci/projets-en-cours/gravimetre/article/gravimetre-a-atomes-froids?lang=en&quot;&gt;capable of detecting even the most minute changes in signals&lt;/a&gt;. The field of atomic physics is so nascent that every year, several novel applications are published, making it one of the most exciting and fastest-growing branches of science.&lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: 13px; margin-top:-15px;&quot;&gt;A modern magneto-optical trap used as the foundation for an atomic quantum computer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;magneto-optical-trapping&quot;&gt;Magneto-Optical Trapping&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does a magneto-optical trap work? The keys, as the name suggests, are &lt;strong&gt;coherent light&lt;/strong&gt; (most commonly found in the form of &lt;strong&gt;lasers&lt;/strong&gt;) and a sufficiently strong &lt;strong&gt;magnetic field gradient&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;magnetics&quot;&gt;Magnetics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since (non-ionized) atoms are inherently ‘neutral’ (having just as many electrons as protons), one might expect them to not interact with an external magnetic field. However, this is not the case – since the electrons and protons share a different spatial density (i.e. are not directly on top of each other), every atom will have a (typically very small) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;magnetic dipole moment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This allows them to interact, albeit weakly, with an applied magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_trap_(atoms)&quot;&gt;magnetic trap&lt;/a&gt; works by creating an energy minima in a region of space through the interaction of the magnetic dipole with the external magnetic field. The spatial energy shift is given by:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\Delta E(\vec{r}) =- \vec{\mu} \cdot \vec{B}(\vec{r})\]

&lt;p&gt;where \(\vec{\mu}\) is the magnetic dipole moment and \(\vec{B}\) is the magnetic field vector. This creates a potential energy well, in which an atom, after equilibrating, would be found at the trough. However, analogously to classical mechanics, a ball rolling in a well may ‘escape’ that well if its kinetic energy is higher than the potential energy difference between the trough and peak of the valley. And, as mentioned earlier, atoms in gaseous or vapor form at room temperature and pressure move extremely fast – between this fact, and the relatively small magnetic dipole moment of neutral atoms, it would take an impractically strong magnetic field to trap room-temperature neutral atoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if the kinetic energy of the atoms were to be reduced, then at some point, we could use a reasonably large magnetic field to create a shift in energy sufficient enough to trap said atoms in a desired region of space. This is where the other half of the MOT comes in – the optics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;optics&quot;&gt;Optics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;electron-excitation&quot;&gt;Electron Excitation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 20px; width:40%; height:auto;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/static/projects/mot/lithium.png&quot; /&gt;
     &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: 13px; margin-top:-15px;&quot;&gt;Some of the electronic energy levels of lithium&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Einstein theorized in the early 20th century, light is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;quantized&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. light waves are made up of individual particles known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon&quot;&gt;photons&lt;/a&gt;. Atoms interact with light through their bound electrons, in a process during which an electron may absorb a photon and gain that photon’s energy. This process is known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_excitation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;electron excitation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and has a reciprocal process known as &lt;strong&gt;electron decay&lt;/strong&gt;, in which an ‘excited’ electron may re-emit the photon it absorbed, and lose that photon’s energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These levels, at first glance, appear to be separated by fixed, definite amounts of energy, and therefore one might expect that a photon must have some exact energy for the atom to absorb it. However, due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/uncertainty.html&quot;&gt;time-energy uncertainty&lt;/a&gt;, this is actually not the case; there is an ‘uncertainty’ inherent in the energy of the excited electronic state, which we denote the &lt;strong&gt;line width&lt;/strong&gt; of the atomic transition. Moreover, by the time-energy uncertainty relation, the wider this line width is, the shorter the lifetime of the excited state (before it decays back to the original state), and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 20px; width:40%; height:auto;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/static/projects/mot/rb_linewidth.jpg&quot; /&gt;
     &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: 13px; margin-top:-15px;&quot;&gt;Line widths for four of the atomic transitions of rubidium&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The line width of an atomic transition tells us what range of frequencies / wavelengths our laser has to be within to be able to excite the electrons in the atoms we’re shining it on. For an atom such as Rubidium-87, and a typical transition we might be interested in, such as the \(5^2 S_{1/2} \to 5^2 P_{3/2}\) (a ground state to a ‘first’ excited state) transition, this line width would be around ~38 MHz, which corresponds to a range of tens of &lt;em&gt;femtometers&lt;/em&gt; in terms of wavelength. In other words, if we want to shine a laser on a Rubidium-87 atom such that it will absorb photons and undergo this transition, we need to make sure that our laser has a wavelength no more than about 40 femtometers from the central transition wavelength of 780,241,209 femtometers. The construction of such a laser is one of the biggest challenges in creating an atomic trap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;doppler-cooling&quot;&gt;Doppler Cooling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume we have a tunable laser with a sufficiently narrow bandwidth. How is it possible that we can make something colder using a laser? After all, if we are imparting energy to an ensemble of atoms, that should only raise the total kinetic energy of the gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer arises from the interaction between electronic excitation and the relativistic Doppler effect. You may be familiar with the aural Doppler effect, in which sounds being emitted by an object moving towards you are heard at a higher pitch, and then drop to a lower pitch as the object moves away from you. In short, the effect here is a shift of the wave to a higher frequency when it is approaching you; this occurs for light in a very similar way to sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure style=&quot;display: block;

  margin-right: auto;

     &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: 13px; margin-top:-15px;&quot;&gt;An animation of the Doppler effect on sound waves. As the vehicle moves to the left, the waves traveling in the same direction are compressed and those traveling away are lengthened.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an atomic trap, an atom that is moving towards a photon from our laser will ‘see’ the photon as having a higher frequency (and therefore, energy) as we see it in the laboratory frame. Therefore, if we tune our laser so that its frequency is slightly below the resonant frequency, the only atoms that will be excited by our laser are the ones that are moving towards it, due to this Doppler effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These excited atoms will eventually decay back down to their ground state. When they do so, they can re-emit the photon they absorbed in any random direction. If they emit the photon in the exact same direction as it was traveling when it was absorbed, then by conservation of momentum, there will be no net change in the velocity of the atom. However, if it emits the photon in any other direction, there will be a net slowing effect on that atom (again, due to conservation of momentum).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have three pairs of counter-propagating beams (ideally in pairwise orthogonal directions), then the net effect is to ‘push’ all the atoms towards the intersection point of these beams, which creates a ‘trapping zone’ for the atoms. When the magnetic trap, described above, is coincident with this beam overlap zone, we have successfully created a magneto-optical trap!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a simplified explanation of the workings of the apparatus; the exact mechanics are a bit more complicated, and require an understanding of quantum mechanics and the Zeeman effect. See Harold Metcalf’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-1470-0&quot;&gt;Laser Cooling and Trapping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for a complete reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;theory-to-practice&quot;&gt;Theory to Practice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic theory of a MOT is not overly complex; a student with a decent background in quantum mechanics might go through the derivations in a couple of weeks. However, such theoretical analyses often implicitly make assumptions about experimental parameters and ambient sources of noise, which in practice do not hold without careful design and assembly. Moreover, the majority of implementation-focused literature published on the subject of MOTs tends to focus on a specific aspect of the apparatus and omit the details relevant to the remaining components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, to fully understand the technical details and requirements for fabricating a MOT, one must study several papers and texts on each of the various sub-systems involved and then figure out how to assemble them, which can be a confusing and painful process. This work aims to provide a ground-up overview of the necessary components of a MOT for rubidium, implementation details on typical forms for each of those components (with a particular focus on minimizing cost), and a discussion of the motivation behind such implementation details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this project is organized into four sections. The first is a discussion of the source of light used to stimulate the canonical ‘cooling’ atomic transition of rubidium-87, including how to fabricate such a source, how to power and control it, the requirements that must be met, and the fundamental reasons for such requirements. The second is a discussion of the required ambient conditions for a MOT, how they can be achieved, and the motivations for such requirements. The third section is a discussion of the optical system that enables magneto-optical trapping, and how to design and implement such a system. The fourth and final section is an analysis the data collected during experimentation with my own personal build.&lt;/p&gt;
